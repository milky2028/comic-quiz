Some special things to note about this quiz, were it to be used in production.
This quiz is reliant on:
* HTML template tags, currently supported in all modern browsers (91% worldwide). IE 11 and below do not support the HTML template tag. To support legacy browsers, a check is required to verify that the HTML template tag is supported. This  check is not included.
* CSS grid, which is currently support in all modern browsers (86% worldwide). IE 10 and 11 require prefixes to support CSS grid. CSS grid is mostly (albeit partially) supported in IE 10 and 11.
* ES6 (ES2015) and ES5 code (specifically let, const, arrow functions, and the fetch API). If IE 11 is an important portion of your site's traffic, I'd recommend using a transpiler, such as Babel, to transpile all ES6 code to ES5. Most of these features are supported in all modern browsers natively, but arrow functions are not supported in IE 11. Let and const are both supported in IE, but no browsers below. forEach is supported in IE 10 and 11, but not below. Fetch is not supported in IE 11 at all.

This quiz uses errorless learning (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errorless_learning).

Code is not minified in source, but should be minified in production.
