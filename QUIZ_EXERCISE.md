# Britannica Quiz Exercise

In this coding exercise, we would like you to build a small site where users can take one of our quizzes.

Primary Objective:
* Create a functional quiz web app using the data provided (quiz.json, questions.json)

A sample user flow could be (but not limited to, get creative!):
1. Introduction page
2. Question/answer page(s) for each quiz question
3. Results page

Bonus Objectives:
* Track the user's responses
* Track the user's score

To demonstrate your proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we ask your submission include the following components:
* Maintainable JavaScript and CSS
* Performance best practices
* Engaging UI and UX (we know this is subjective, but have some fun!)

Don't concern yourself with the idiosyncrasies of legacy browsers. Just make sure to express your knowledge of the languages through your code.

You're free to create this app however you wish, we just ask that you please include a README describing how to run the app and anything else you think should be included for the team to know. Please attach the source code in a ZIP file when you have completed the exercise.
